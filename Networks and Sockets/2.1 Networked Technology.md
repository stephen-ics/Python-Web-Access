# Networked Technology
## Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
TCP works on top of the Internal Protocol (IP)

While IP sends packets across networks, it doesn't gurantee that all packets will make it to the destination, packets can be lost or arrive out of order

TCP's job is to make sure that even if IP loses some data, the data eventually gets delivered correctly and in order, it does this by tracking what has been sent, receiving acknowledgements, and if something goes missing it will retransmit the lost parts

## TCP Connections/Sockets
In computer networking, an Internet socket or network socket is an endpoint of a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an Internet Protocol-based computer network, such as the Internet

On the internet, different services listen on specific "doorways" called **ports**, a port number combined with an IP address tells you exactly which service on which computer you're communicatign with

Common TCP ports
- Telnet (23) - Login
- SSH (22) - Secure Login
- HTTP (80)
- HTTPS (443) - Secure
- SMTP (25) - Mail
- IMAP (143/220/993) - Mail Retrieval
- POP (109/110) - Mail Retrieval
- DNS (53) - Domain Name
- FTP (21) - File Transfer

Sometimes we see the port number in the URL if the web server is running on a "non-standard" port

Below will be some Python code to create a socket connection
```py
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STEAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
