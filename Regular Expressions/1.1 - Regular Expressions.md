# Regular Expressions
A really clever "wild card" expression for matching and parsing strings

## Regular Expression Quick Guide
- `^` Matches the beginning of a line
- `$` Matches the end of a line
- `.` Matches any character
- `\s` Matches whitespace
- `\S` Matches any non-whitespace character
- `*` Repeats a character zero or more times
- `*?` Repeats a character zero or more times (non-greedy)
- `+` Repeats a character one or more times
- `+?` Repeats a character one or more times (non-greedy)
- `[aeiou]` Matches a single character in the listed set
- `[^XYZ]` Matches a single character not in the listed set
- `[a-z0-9]` The set of characters can include a range
- `(` Indicates where string extraction is to start
- `)` Indicates where string extraction is to end

## The Regular Expression Module
Before you can use regular expressions in your program, you must import the library using "import re"

You can use `re.search()` to see if a string matches a regular expression, similar to using the `find()` method for strings

You can use `re.findall()` to extract portions of a string that match your regular expressions, similar to a combination of `find()` and slicing
 
## Uses of Regex
**Using re.search() like startswith()**
We can use `re.search()` exactly like the `startswith()` function
```py
import re

txt = open('hello.txt')
for line in txt:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From: ', line):
        print(line)
```

**Wild-Card Characters**
The dot character matches any character

If you add the asterisk character, the character is "any number of times" (`^X.*:`), this will look for lines that start with X followed by some number of characters that end with a colon

We can fine-tune the match to be more specific, for example `^X-\S+:` matches character starting with `X-` with any non-whitespace character one or more times ending with a `:`
