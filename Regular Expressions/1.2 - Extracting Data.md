# Matching and Extracting Data
`re.search()` returns a True/False depending on whether the string matches the regular expression

If we actually want the matching strings to be attached, we use `re.findall()`

`[0 - 9]+` finds one or more digits
```py
import re

x = 'My 2 favourite numbers are 19 and 42'
y = re.findall('[0-9]+', x)
```
This outputs: `['2', '19', '42']`

## Non-Greedy Matching
Regex usually does greedy matches, this means if there is a larger string that also matches the regular expression, the regex will output the larger string

If we add a `?` character, the `+` and `*` chill out a bit and return the shortest matching regex

## The Double Split Pattern
Sometimes we split a line one way, and then grab one of the pieces of the line and split that piece again

We can use regular expressions to accomplish this
```py
import re

line = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan'
y = re.findall('@([^ ]*)', line)
print(y)
```
The output will be `['uct.ac.za']`, here we start splitting at `(` so we don't include the `@` in the output

`[^ ]` matches a non-blank character as the only character in the list is a blank character and `^` negates it

## The Escape Character
If you want a special regular expression character to just behave normally (most ofo the time), you prefix it with `\`
```py
import re

x = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'
y = re.findall('\$[0-9.]+', x)
print(y)
```
['$10.00']

Here the `$` becomes a real dollar sign
